# How to use Linux terminals

If you've never used a Linux terminal before (also called a shell or
command-line interface), it can be intimidating. We think 
[this interactive tutorial](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell) that runs
in your browser is a good way to learn the basics.

# Shell scripting

Check out the following links. `bash` is the default shell in Termux and the
most popular one* even if you decide you want to user another shell later,
knowledge of `bash` is portable and useful.

# Programming

People spend lifetimes learning how to program! There are no shortcuts: it
takes a lot of time, effort, and patience. One mistake new programmers often
make is focusing too much on languages - it's much better to pick a language
with a large community and focus on learning how to write programs generally
than to jump from new thing to new thing without learning much about anything.
Don't stress too much about picking The Best Language.

We'll put tutorials for specific languages that we think are good here. If you
need help with a language not listed, feel free to ask - maybe someone knows it.

# Infosec

Information security is a deep and exciting topic, but by its nature, there's
some rules. The following things are generally true of people who do legal,
ethical, and interesting work in computer security, and especially of white-hat
hackers:

* They never even attempt to access data or systems without the full knowledge
  and consent of their owners.
* They have strong general technical skills. You have to understand how to make
  things to be good at breaking them. If you aren't already comfortable making
  websites, you aren't ready to learn how to compromise websites.
* They don't get their info from YouTube vids. Interesting computer security
  topics typically require a lot of background information and complex steps to
  repro. Get comfortable reading.

If you're sure this is for you and you're ready, here's some links:

* [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/)
* [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

# How to ask questions

Asking the right questions and asking them well is as much a core skill in
computers as knowing about programming languages or hardware. This advice will
help you learn any technical topic and get the most out of support communities
like Termux's.

* Google first. If you're doing something other people have done before, there's
  a good chance some of them hit the same problems you did and posted about them
  somewhere.
* Include your main goal - the thing you are actually trying to accomplish at
  the top level - in addition the problem you think you're stuck on. It is
  *extremely* common to spend a lot of time helping someone with a specific
  issue, only to find out later that they were going a completely wrong
  direction and it would have been obvious if they'd followed this advice.
* Include the context, and everything you've tried so far and what happened when
  you did. Don't assume people know about that Minecraft server you're trying to
  run, and don't waste time in a loop of "have you tried x?" -> "yes, that
  didn't work".
* Include *exact error messages* or screenshots.
