# Hacking

You may be reading this page because you asked for help using Termux to:
* access someone else's data, computers, network, or accounts without their
  consent
* send messages, posts, or traffic to someone who doesn't want it
* install tools that are dominantly for that kind of thing, such as Kali

**tl;dr: Termux official communities do not provide support for these uses, and
asking more than once is one of the fastest paths to a ban.** If you were sent
this link in response to a question and think it may not apply to you, read the
rest before posting anything else.

## Excuses we have heard before

* **"a youtube video told me Termux was for hacking"**: Anyone can make YouTube
  videos, and general-purpose tools like Termux can be used for general
  purposes. Read the tl;dr again.
* **"I am studying computer security"**: Great!
  * If you're new to programming, Linux, networking, and other core topics in
    that field, you need to learn how to make things before learning how to
    break them. We love helping people explore how things work and gain
    programming experience; put away the hacking tools for now.
  * If you are familiar with the core topics and need community help learning
    security to apply it ethically, there are many online communities focused on
    this. Don't ask for a pointer to one - this should be the easiest part of
    your journey.
* **someone is doing something evil and I need to hack them back**: If you need
  help just installing hacking tools, you do not have the skills to get into a
  computer fight with bad guys. Contact the humans responsible for abuse reports
  on the sites or domains they're using, or local law enforcement.
* **"... then why is `$HACKING_TOOL` in the repos?"**: Termux maintainers make
  case-by-case decisions about whether to accept packages based on the balance
  of their usefulness. For example, we package `nmap`, which can be used
  unethically but is a core tool for network diagnostics, but don't package
  `metasploit`, which is accurately characterized as an engine for breaking into
  other people's computers.
* **"... then why was `$DISCUSSION` allowed?"**: Community moderators have
  discretion to allow or disallow individual discussions based on the context of
  the question or familiarity with the person asking. For example, "how can I
  use Termux to collect info about a person?" sounds a lot like "help me with
  doxxing", which is definitely not something we want to be a part of.
